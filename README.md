# bhagwat-vaccine-tracker
Tracks COVID-19 doses shipped and assigns appointments at random to people in different eligibility groups.

It also tracks who is vaccinated in a current area. 

This has not been tested on production data, all data is mocked. The intent is to put this into production and connect production data about COVID vaccinations.
